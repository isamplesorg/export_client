# iSamples Viewer

!!PROTOTYPE!!

This is a work in progress.

Assuming the export client code is checked out to `export_client`, the folder `export_client/ui` is generated by:

```
# cwd = export_client
cd ui_src
npm install

#important - this patches observable to use the latest duckdb-wasm

patch -i npm.js.patch -o node_modules/@observablehq/framework/dist/npm.js

npm run build
```

The UI can be then viewed by running (assumes [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) is installed):

```
# cwd = export_client
http-server --cors -p 8080 -a 127.0.0.1  -c5
```

then visiting http://localhost:8080/ui/ds_view

Alternate content may be viewed by adding `#SOURCE_URL` to the url, for example:

http://localhost:8080/ui/ds_view#http://localhost:8080/example/test/isamples_export_geo.parquet

The data source defaults to `http://localhost:8080/example/test/isamples_export_geo.parquet`.

The markdown source for the page is in `export_client/ui_src/src` and it uses the
[Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) extensions.

A development server which re-renders the content on change can be started using:

```
# cwd = export_client/ui_src
npm run start
```

That will start the dev server at `http://localhost:3000/`. Note that this also requires the static pages server 
to be running to serve the content from `http://localhost:8080/`


Standard Observable Framework Readme follows.

---

This is an [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework) project. To start the local preview server, run:

```
npm run dev
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000> to preview your project.

## Project structure

A typical Framework project looks like this:

```ini
.
├─ src
│  ├─ components
│  │  └─ timeline.js           # an importable module
│  ├─ data
│  │  ├─ launches.csv.js       # a data loader
│  │  └─ events.json           # a static data file
│  ├─ example-dashboard.md     # a page
│  ├─ example-report.md        # another page
│  └─ index.md                 # the home page
├─ .gitignore
├─ observablehq.config.js      # the project config file
├─ package.json
└─ README.md
```

**`src`** - This is the “source root” — where your source files live. Pages go here. Each page is a Markdown file. Observable Framework uses [file-based routing](https://observablehq.com/framework/routing), which means that the name of the file controls where the page is served. You can create as many pages as you like. Use folders to organize your pages.

**`src/index.md`** - This is the home page for your site. You can have as many additional pages as you’d like, but you should always have a home page, too.

**`src/data`** - You can put [data loaders](https://observablehq.com/framework/loaders) or static data files anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here.

**`src/components`** - You can put shared [JavaScript modules](https://observablehq.com/framework/javascript/imports) anywhere in your source root, but we recommend putting them here. This helps you pull code out of Markdown files and into JavaScript modules, making it easier to reuse code across pages, write tests and run linters, and even share code with vanilla web applications.

**`observablehq.config.js`** - This is the [project configuration](https://observablehq.com/framework/config) file, such as the pages and sections in the sidebar navigation, and the project’s title.
